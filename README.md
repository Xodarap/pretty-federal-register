Pretty Federal Register
=================

This chrome extension adds several navigation features to the FR site:

1. It adds hyperlinks to the table of contents, making the items in the TOC link to the relevant parts of the document
2. It displays the fully qualified path of headers (e.g. "II.B.1" instead of just "1.")

It is based around the implicit format that Medicare uses and, as this is merely
an implicit format, may or may not work for other agencies.
